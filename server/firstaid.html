    - How many people are involved?<br><br>
    
    - What is my initial impression about the nature of the person’s illness or injury? Does the person have any life-threatening conditions, such as severe, life-threatening bleeding?<br><br>
    
    - Is anyone else available to help?<br><br><br>
    
    2.If the Person is awake and Responsive and there is no severe life-threatening bleeding:<br><br>
    
    - Obtain consent: Tell the person your name, describes type and level of training, states what you thinks is wrong and what you plans to do, and asks permission to provide care.<br><br>
    
    - Tell a bystander to get the AED and first aid kit: Point to a bystander and speak out loud.<br><br>

Check for Responsiveness and breathing for no more than 5-10 seconds.<br><br><br>
